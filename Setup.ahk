/*
AHK-Library-Setup

ABOUT
=====

A "Setup" system for AHK library writers to ensure the machines of people using their library are set up correctly to use it.

It performs the following primary functions:

* Places a "Redirect" .ahk file in the AutoHotkey lib that points to the library.
This allows any ahk file to #include <library name>, whilst letting the actual source of the library remain outside the AHK Lib folder (Say in a GitHub repo folder)

* Checks that AutoHotkey is installed.

* Checks that AHK is not an old version from AutoHotkey.com

USAGE
=====

Rename the script appropriately, eg "Setup AutoHotkey for MyNewLib.ahk"
Edit the variables in the DEVELOPER SETTINGS section.
While testing for release, you may keep DebugMode on 1

When releasing, set DebugMode to 0, then COMPILE this script (Right click, Compile to EXE)
You do not need to bundle the ahk file with the Library.

*/

; ========================== DEVELOPER SETTINGS ========================================

; Debug mode ON suppresses welcome message and compiled check. You MUST turn DebugMode OFF before compiling for distribution
DebugMode		:= 1

; Which files you wish to add Redirects to in the AHK lib folder
LibFiles		:= ["MyTestLib.ahk"]

; Size of the Setup Window [x,y]. You can omit Y (or set it to 0) and the GUI will Auto-Size.
WindowSize		:= [300,0]

; If you want to leave some instructions to users, put text in this var and it will appear in the DEVELOPER NOTES section.
; This section may not appear if the UI is too small.
; If you want a lot of text, you will have to manually set WindowSize[2].
DevNotes		:= ""
